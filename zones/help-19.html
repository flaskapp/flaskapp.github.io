		<dl>
			<dt id="running_vertical">Vertical Oscillation</dt>
			<dd>It is the value that the body goes up and down per one step. <br />
			It is said that the lower the number, the better the running efficiency and the better the running form.<br />
			</dd>
			<dt id="running_gct">Ground Contact Time</dt>
			<dd> It's the time your feet are on the ground per step. Experienced runners tend to have shorter times.</dd>
			<dt id="running_power">Running Stride Length</dt>
			<dd>It is stride length per one step. Also called stride.</dd>
			<dt id="running_speed">Running Speed</dt>
			<dd>The running speed as measured by watchOS. Please note that the value is different from the speed calculated from the "Distance" data.<br />
			The cadence (spm) value displayed in the animation area is a value calculated from "Running Stride Length" and "Running Speed".			</dd>
