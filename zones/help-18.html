		<p>
			Measure workout with "Downhill Skiing" and "Snowboarding" activities, you can record distances, slope slope etc using Apple Watch's barometer.
		</p>
		<p>
			This function is newly added in watch OS 4.2.<br />
			Apple Watch (watch OS) is doing measurement and calculation of distance, Zones saves the result.<br />
			For information on the measurement contents, please refer to Apple's reference.<br />
			Apple Reference: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutactivitytype/hkworkoutactivitytypesnowboarding/receiving_downhill_skiing_and_snowboarding_data">Receiving Downhill Skiing and Snowboarding Data</a>

		<p>

			This help contains information based on our experiences and there is the possibility of inaccurate information.<br />
			If you notice any problems, it will be helpful if you can contact us via feedback from the app settings!
		</p>

		<h2>Distance Measurement Condition</h2>
		<p>Distances and segments are recorded only when all of the following conditions are satisfied.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Zones ver 2.0 or over</li>
			<li>iOS11.2, watch OS 4.2 or over</li>
			<li>Apple Watch Series 3 or over</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Although it is possible to record workouts other than the above, distance and segments are not recorded.
		</p>


		<h2>Attention on Measurement</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Turn On "Auto Pause"</li>
				<li>The active / pause state may not react in real time, but you can record it.</li>
				<li>When it detects downhill, it becomes active state.</li>
				<li>If you do an action such as climbing a mountain again, you will be in a state of pause. At this timing, the last downhill data will be recorded.</li>
				<li>Distance and Speed is not displayed in real time. (The previous values ​​are displayed.)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Recorded Data</h2>

		<p>
			Distance and Segments are recorded.<br />
			These are the data created by the watch OS.<br />
			Therefore, behaviors may differ due to differences in watch OS version.<br />
		</p>

		<h3>Distance</h3>
		<p>
			Your distance data records to "Downhill Snow Sports Distance" by watch OS.<br />
			Zones collects this distance data and register to your workout.
			You can check the distance data in Apple's "Health" app.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is not a distance calculation using difference of GPS position like running and walking, so distance is not measured even if you move on a flat ground.<br />
		</p>

		<h3>Segment</h3>
		<p>
			When a downhill is detected, the detailed information is recorded as a segment.<br />
			The segment contains the following information.<br />
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Average Speed</li>
			<li>Maximum Speed</li>
			<li>Slope Gradient</li>
			<li>Descent Altitude</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			You can see  <a href="help-19.html#14">Workout Segments on workout details</a> on the Zones iPhone app.
		</p>

		<h3>When recording fails</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Please check whether the measurement conditions are satisfied.</li>
			<li>Please exercise with altitude changing.<br />Distance is not measured even if you move on a flat ground.</li>
			<li>If it is not a movement that goes downhill, even if the altitude changes, it may not be possible to record.<br />
					(Vertical movement like elevator ascending and descending)</li>
		</ol>
