		<h1>Recovery Heart Rate</h1>

		<p>Recovery Heart Rate is the difference between your exercising heart rate
			and your heart rate one minutes after the exercise has stopped.<br />
			It is a good indicator to gauge your fitness level!
		</p>
		<p　style="font-size: 1.3em;">Recovery Heart Rate = Exercising reart rate - Heart rate one minutes after the exercise</p>

		<p>It is better this value is larger.<br />
			Since the value changes greatly depending on how much you raise the heart rate, please increase the heart rate above a certain level before measuring.<br />
			For comparison, it would be better to measure from the same heart rate.
		</p>

		<h2>How to Measure</h2>
		<p>In version 6 or later, it is now possible to display the heart rate after 1 minute and 2 minutes without measuring the recovery heart rate of Zones.
		</p>
		<p>
At the time of the initial release of Zones, watchOS did not have the ability to record the recovery heart rate.
Now, watchOS has been improved to continuously record heart rate for several minutes after the end of a workout.
		</p>
<!--
		<p>
			After finishing the workout, measurement of recovery heart rate will be start.<br />
			Please stop exercise during measurement and wait for recovery of heart rate.</p>

		<h3>!! Important Things !!</h3>
		<p>
			"Recovery heart rate" refers to the heart’s ability to return to normal levels after physical activity.<br />
			Therefore, it is necessary to start the measurement from the state with increased heart rate.<br />
			For this reason, we created "Threshold" as the condition to start the measurement.<br />
			If the heart rate zone is below the threshold at the end of the workout, the recovery heart rate will not be measured.
		</p>

		<h2>Threshold (since ver1.4.0)</h2>
		<p>
			"Threshold" can be changed at edit of Heart Rate Zone in Settings.
		</p>
		<img src="img/help03_03.png" width="185px" />
		<p>
			The threshold defaults is CARDIO.<br />
			In ver 1.3.0 and lower versions, the threshold is fixed "CARDIO".<br />
			To change the setting you need to purchase PRO.
		</p>

-->
		<h2>Confirmation</h2>
		<p>The measured recovery heart rate can be confirmed on the workout details screen.</p>
		<img src="img/help03_01.png" width="187px"/>
		<p>
		In version 6 or later, "Recovery Heart Rate" cannot be set as an item to be displayed in Insights.
You can continue to use Insight that has already been set, but the Recovery Heart Rate in Insight and in workout details may differ in numerical values. The difference in values is due to time lag in measurement and other reasons.
